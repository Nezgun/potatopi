List off the things you want the plugin to do:

Get data off of the server and write it to a file.
This can already be accomplished by parsing the log file
So just adding extra logging will be sufficient.


Files:
Trust file:
UUID|Times Joined|Time Played In Seconds|Usernames Used|Games Won|Games Lost|Trust|Mutes|Kick Count|Banned?
Calculate time played on disconnect/connect



What kind of data shall we log?
Player Join Event-- TIME, UUID, USERNAME
Player Leave Event -- Append trust data to file. Compress each entry with base64 for a basic encryption (write encryption?)

BuildSelectEvent--
Fired any time a building is started construction or is continued to be built. --Fires each tick that something is being built/broken
Probably do not want to use this event for changing trust values except if thorium is built near core.
