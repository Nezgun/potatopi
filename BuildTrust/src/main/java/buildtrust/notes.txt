List off the things you want the plugin to do:

Get data off of the server and write it to a file.
This can already be accomplished by parsing the log file
So just adding extra logging will be sufficient.


Files:
Trust file:
1            2  3        4 5 6   7 8 9
5LMYdasgAAA=,0,Fealtous.,0,0,500,0,0,false,

Calculate time played on disconnect/connect
int trust, String uuid, int wins, int losses, ArrayList<String> names, int kickcount, boolean bannedPast, boolean muted, int mutecount, int joincount)


What kind of data shall we log?
Player Join Event-- TIME, UUID, USERNAME (Add entry into file)
Player Leave Event -- Make temp file Compress each entry with base64 for a basic encryption (write encryption?)
Editing specific lines as needed

BuildSelectEvent--
Fired any time a building is started construction or is continued to be built. --Fires each tick that something is being built/broken
Probably do not want to use this event for changing trust values except if thorium is built near core.
